Never know when a new exciting post arrives to Hackaday.com? With Hackaday
monitor & Lighting Box you will know moments after it gets published!
Need a weather forecast? Not a problem, you'll have it printed and waiting
for you as soon as you wake up. Did I mention it will be stuffed with RGB
LEDs to lighten up the mood? 

This repository will hold all documents, designs and sourcecode of the project.
